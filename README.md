# StranglJS
 StranGL (Strange Graphics Library) JS 3d graphics library.
 
A simple 3d graphics library I made at work. I made a few changes here at home, so I haven't tested this version out yet.

Features simple depth sorthing and lighting. Requires CreateJS libraries (for HTML5) to run. Integrates well with Adobe Animate. I don't have official API docs yet, so read my comments for now.

This is NOT a WebGL library.
